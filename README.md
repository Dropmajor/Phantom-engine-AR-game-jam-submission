# Phantom-engine-AR-game-jam-code
The code of my winning submission to the Phantom Engine 72 hour game jam. Developed in Unity and code in C#<br>
The theme of the game jam was: "one room".<br/>
The code is quite messy as it was never refactored due to the time limited nature of the jam <br>
Please note that since I dont own a mobile device with the required features to use the AR functionality of the phantom engine library all the examples are in the development environment. I only ever got the chance to truly test the AR functionality when presenting the submission<br/>
